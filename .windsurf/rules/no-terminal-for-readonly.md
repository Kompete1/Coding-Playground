# No Terminal For Read-Only Tasks
Activation Mode: Always On

When working in this repo:
- Do NOT run terminal commands for simple reads (e.g., printing file contents, searching text, counting lines). Use the editor and propose diffs instead.
- Only use `git` commands when necessary for clean commits/branches/PRs; never use `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, or interactive rebases.
- NEVER invoke `powershell.exe` unless I explicitly ask.
- If you believe a command-line is required, ask me first.
