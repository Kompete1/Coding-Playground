# Starter Landing Page

This project provides a lightweight starting point for a responsive, accessible landing page built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Preview Locally
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
2. Use a lightweight static server (e.g., VS Code Live Server, `python -m http.server`) pointed at the project folder.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — semantic layout with section comments to guide customization.
- `styles.css` — CSS variables, responsive grid, and motion-reduction helpers.
- `main.js` — mobile navigation toggle, smooth scrolling, and auto-updating footer year.
- `assets/` — static media including the placeholder `logo.svg`.

## Extend for Future Pages
1. Duplicate `index.html` and adjust section IDs, copy, and links as needed.
2. Reuse `styles.css` by adding new components near related rules or creating additional stylesheets.
3. Keep interactivity small and vanilla in `main.js` to avoid build tooling.
4. When a form becomes functional, replace the placeholder submit button behavior with a real handler.
